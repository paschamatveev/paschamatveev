            Hello! My name is Pascha and I am currently a student at the University of Washington 
            where I study Neuroscience and Neural Computation and Engineering. I am interested in 
            learning and memory and want to explore more molecular approaches to compliment my
            systems, behavioral, and computational knowledge. <br> <br>
            Other than my research, I am an avid community member and love to host and participate in 
            outreach programs and teaching efforts. <br> <br>
            I hope to enter graduate school in fall of 2025 (interview season is upon us!). Check back to see
            where I end up.
